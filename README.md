# Employee Management System

## 📋 Problem Statement

Managing employee records can be a tedious task for organizations, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. There is a need for an efficient system that allows for easy management of employee information, including adding new records, updating existing ones, and deleting outdated records. This system should also provide a user-friendly interface to streamline these interactions and ensure data integrity.

## 💡 Solution

- **Add New Employee:** Allows users to create new employee records and input essential details.
- **Update Employee Records:** Enables users to modify existing employee information.
- **Delete Employee Records:** Provides functionality to remove outdated or incorrect employee records.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed a clean and intuitive front-end interface to enhance user experience and facilitate easy navigation.
